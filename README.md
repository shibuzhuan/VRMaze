# VRMaze
The virtual maze is automatically generated in unity, and the user sets the virtual object. Use storm magic mirror or Google SDK to realize the three-dimensional display of left and right eyes; Kinect is used to capture the user's position and action, and send the data to the mobile terminal to realize the interaction between the user and the virtual scene.
